# 🎨 100 Days CSS Challenge

The [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/about/) is a series of CSS exercises designed to improve skills in animation, layout, and styling. Each challenge involves creating a small UI component or animation using only HTML and CSS.


## 🚀 Project Overview
Each day, I complete a CSS challenge and share my work on CodePen. You can check my progress on https://100dayscss.com/progress/sim-the-jiji/
