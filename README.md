# üé® 100 Days CSS Challenge

The [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/about/) is a series of CSS exercises designed to improve skills in animation, layout, and styling. Each challenge involves creating a small UI component or animation using only HTML and CSS.


## üöÄ Project Overview
Each day, I complete a CSS challenge and share my work on CodePen. You can check my progress on https://100dayscss.com/progress/sim-the-jiji/

| 1    | An easy start into the challenge with a custom build number with gradient. | [view](https://codepen.io/sim-the-jiji/pen/yyLjOoq) |
| 2    | Menu Icon: Used on almost every website by now, simple but impressively animated it becomes a real eye-catcher. | [view](https://codepen.io/sim-the-jiji/pen/pvoVOGP) |
| 3    | The Pyramide: Not as challenging as the real pyramids in Egypt, but the shadow path is not easy. | [view](https://codepen.io/sim-the-jiji/pen/raNKEZN) |
| 4    | Loading: The best are always websites that do not need a loading status. If they do, here would be a calming one. | [view](https://codepen.io/sim-the-jiji/pen/OPJrexK) |
